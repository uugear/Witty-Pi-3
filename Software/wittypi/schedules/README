How to use these .wpi files?
===============================================================================
  The .wpi files in this directory are Witty Pi schedule script examples. When 
you run wittyPi.sh, you can choose a schedule script there. The schedule 
script file you selected will be copied to the Witty Pi install directory 
(~/wittypi), and the next shutdown and startup will be scheduled automatically 
for you.

  You can also manually copy the schedule script to "~/wittypi/schedule.wpi" 
and then run "sudo ./runScript" to get the same result.

===============================================================================
How to create your own .wpi file?
===============================================================================
  You can use any text editor to create/edit your own .wpi file. Then you can 
use it like other .wpi files in this directory.

  The content of .wpi file defines a loop, which specifies each ON/OFF state 
and its duration. Your Raspberry Pi will automatically run the runScript.sh 
after booting, which will schedule the next shutdown and startup, according to 
the script content. As long as the current time is between the BEGIN and END 
time of the script, the loop will continue.

  Please take other .wpi files as examples. You will need to define the BEGIN 
and END time of the loop, and each ON/OFF state in the loop. The duration of 
the state is define by putting D?, H?, M? and S? parameter after the state 
type (ON/OFF), while D as Days, H as Hours, M as Minutes, S as Seconds and ? 
is a number. For example, "D1 H2 M3 S10" means 1 day 2 hours 3 minutes and 10 
seconds, while "H5 M2" means 5 hours and 2 minutes.

  An ON state will be ended by a scheduled shutdown, while an OFF state will be
end by a scheduled startup. If you want to skip any shutdown/startup, just append
"WAIT" at the end of the state, and make sure your program will shutdown your
Raspberry Pi after finishing its job.

Sometimes you may want to skip certain scheduling of shutdown/startup, and let 
your own program to do the job. This can be achieved by using the WAIT syntax.
Here is an example:

ON M15 WAIT

This will keep your Raspberry Pi ON and no shutdown will be scheduled after 15 
minutes, because there is a WAIT at the end of the line. The parameter M15 is here 
only to make sure the next OFF state can be calculated correctly and next shutdown 
can be scheduled properly. Once you use WAIT in the ON state, you are responsible 
for the shutdown of your Raspberry Pi. Also if you use WAIT in the OFF state, you 
will need to turn on your Raspberry Pi (manually or via external electronic switch).
